# Testing BERT Topic Modelling 
The purpose is to test the possibilities of using BERT to topic modelling for future projects. 
The BERT-Topic modelling give more possiblities than the LDA algorithm. Especially the interactive (with ploty) visualisation of the overview of the many topics that BERT generates from the material. 

```python
topic_model.visualize_topics()
```

I have done this analysis based on database containing abstracts from research articles.
